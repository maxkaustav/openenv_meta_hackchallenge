"""
FastAPI application entry-point for the Healthcare Appointment Scheduling environment.

Exposes the standard OpenEnv HTTP endpoints:
  POST /reset    start a new episode
  POST /step     take an action
  GET  /state    read internal episode state
  GET  /health   liveness probe

The `create_fastapi_app` factory from openenv-core wires these up automatically.
